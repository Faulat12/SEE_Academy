- Performs **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** ➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗
- Displays the results in a fun and friendly format 🎉
- Works with **decimals** using Python’s `float()` 🎯

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. Make sure you have **Python installed** on your machine (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Clone or copy the code into a `.py` file. Example: `fun_calculator.py`
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
